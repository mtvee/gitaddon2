# GitAddon2

This is a git addon for Godot 3.x. It uses the system git command rather
then a library so there are the following tradeoffs/bonuses:

- credentials are handled by the system git
- lightweight, just gdscript
- functionality is limited to basic day to day git commands: add/stage/commit/push/pull. If I need more then that I use a terminal.
